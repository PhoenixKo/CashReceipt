# CashReceipt
Java project that uses threads to create receipts for 2 cashiers when they check out products for their customers.


When the program is ran it creates 2 text files that record the date of creating the receipt, the time and goods with their ID, name and expiration date.
(The numbers used in the receipts are just for examples)
